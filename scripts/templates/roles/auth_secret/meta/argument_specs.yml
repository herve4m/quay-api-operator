      Retrieve Quay connection parameters from a secret resource
    description:
      - Retrieve the Quay Container Registry credentials from the given
        secret resource.
      - Store the retrieved parameters as Ansible facts so that other roles
        can use them.
      - The I(quay_host) fact is set from the C(host) field in the secret
        resource.
      - The I(validate_certs) fact is set from the C(validateCerts) field in
        the secret resource.
      - The I(quay_token) fact is set from the C(token) field in the secret
        resource.
      - The I(quay_username) fact is set from the C(username) field in the
        secret resource.
      - The I(quay_password) fact is set from the C(password) field in the
        secret resource.
      - The C(token) and the C(username)/C(password) fields are mutually
        exclusive. If the secret resource includes all these fields, then the
        authentication to the API uses the token, and the C(username) and
        C(password) fields are ignored.
    options:
      conn_secret_ref:
        description:
          - Reference to the secret resource that stores the connection
            parameters to the Quay Container Registry API.
        type: dict
        required: true
        options:
          name:
            description:
              - Name of the secret resource that stores the Quay Container
                Registry credentials.
              - In this secret resource, the C(host) fields must store the API
                URL, such as U(https://quay.example.com:8443) for example.
              - The C(token) field provides the OAuth access token for
                authenticating against the API. If this field is specified, then
                C(username) and C(password) are ignored.
              - The C(validateCerts) field specifies whether to allow insecure
                connections to the API.

          namespace:
            description:
              - Kubernetes namespace of the secret resource.
              - By default, the secret is retrieved from the same namespace as
                the Quay custom resource.

        options:
          namespace:
            description:
              - Kubernetes namespace of the custom resource.
              - If I(conn_secret_ref['namespace']) is not set, then
                I(ansible_operator_meta['namespace']) is used instead.
            type: str
          name:
            description:
              - Kubernetes name of the custom resource.
