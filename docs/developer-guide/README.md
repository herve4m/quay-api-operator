# Developer Guide

The API Operator for Quay is an Ansible Operator that is based on the [Quay Container Registry Collection for Ansible](https://github.com/herve4m/quay-collection).

Most of the Operator artifacts has been automatically generated by the `scripts/ansible2operator` Python script, which converts the Ansible modules to Kubernetes resources.
