# Organization - Manage Quay Container Registry organizations

The Organization custom resource relies on a Secret resource to provide the connection parameters to the Quay instance.
This Secret resource must include the following data:

* `host`: URL for accessing the Quay API, such as ``https://quay.example.com:8443`` for example.
* `validateCerts`: Whether to allow insecure connections to the API.
  By default, insecure connections are refused.
* `token`: OAuth access token for authenticating against the API.
  To create such a token see the [Creating an OAuth Access Token](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3/html-single/red_hat_quay_api_guide/index#creating-oauth-access-token) documentation.
  You can also use the [ApiToken](ApiToken.md) custom resource to create this token.
* `username`: The username to use for authenticating against the API.
  If `token` is set, then `username` is ignored.
* `password`: The password to use for authenticating against the API.
  If `token` is set, then `password` is ignored.

You can create the secret by using the `kubectl create secret` command:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic quay-credentials --from-literal host=https://quay.example.com:8443 --from-literal validateCerts=false --from-literal token=vFYyU2D0fHYXvcA3Y5TYfMrIMyVIH9YmxoVLsmku
```

Or you can create the secret from a resource file:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: quay-credentials
stringData:
  host: https://quay.example.com:8443
  validateCerts: "false"
  token: vFYyU2D0fHYXvcA3Y5TYfMrIMyVIH9YmxoVLsmku
```

You refer to this secret in your Organization custom resource by using the `connSecretRef` property.
See the [usage example](#usage-example).

!!! warning
    Do not delete the Secret resource if a Quay custom resource still references it.
    If you delete the Secret resource, then the Operator cannot connect to the Quay API anymore, and cannot synchronize the Quay custom resource with its corresponding object in Quay.
    In addition, deleting the Quay custom resource does not complete because the Operator cannot delete the corresponding object in Quay.

    If you face this issue, then edit the custom resource (`kubectl edit`), and set the [.spec.preserveInQuayOnDeletion](#preserveinquayondeletion) property to `true`.
    Alternatively, you can remove the `.metadata.finalizers` section.
    In both case, you must manually delete the corresponding object in Quay.


## Usage Example

```yaml
---
apiVersion: quay.herve4m.github.io/v1alpha1
kind: Organization
metadata:
  name: organization-sample
spec:
  # Connection parameters in a Secret resource
  connSecretRef:
    name: quay-credentials
    # By default, the operator looks for the secret in the same namespace as
    # the organization resource, but you can specify a different namespace.
    # namespace: mynamespace

  # Whether to preserve the corresponding Quay object when you
  # delete the Organization resource.
  preserveInQuayOnDeletion: false

  name: production
  email: prodlist@example.com
  timeMachineExpiration: 7d
  autoPruneMethod: tags
  autoPruneValue: "20"

```


## Properties


### autoPruneMethod

Method to use for the auto-pruning tags policy. If `none`, then the resource ensures that no policy is in place. The tags are not pruned. If `tags`, then the policy keeps only the number of tags that you specify in `autoPruneValue`. If `date`, then the policy deletes the tags older than the time period that you specify in `autoPruneValue`. `autoPruneValue` is required when `autoPruneMethod` is `tags` or `date`.

__Type__: string

__Required__: False

__Default value__: None

### autoPruneValue

Number of tags to keep when `autoPruneMethod` is `tags`. The value must be 1 or more. Period of time when `autoPruneMethod` is `date`. The value must be 1 or more, and must be followed by a suffix; s (for second), m (for minute), h (for hour), d (for day), or w (for week). `autoPruneMethod` is required when `autoPruneValue` is set.

__Type__: string

__Required__: False

__Default value__: None

### connSecretRef

Reference to the secret resource that stores the connection parameters to the Quay Container Registry API.
The secret must include the `host`, `token` (or `username` and `password`), and optionally the `validateCerts` keys.


__Type__: object (see the following properties)

__Required__: True

__Default value__: None

### connSecretRef.name

Name of the secret resource.

__Type__: string

__Required__: True

__Default value__: None

### connSecretRef.namespace

Namespace of the secret resource. By default, the secret resource is retrieved from the same namespace as the current Organization resource.


__Type__: string

__Required__: False

__Default value__: None

### email

Email address to associate with the new organization. If your Quay administrator has enabled the mailing capability of your Quay installation (`FEATURE_MAILING` to `true` in `config.yaml`), then this `email` parameter is mandatory. You cannot use the same address as your account email.

__Type__: string

__Required__: False

__Default value__: None

### name

Name of the organization to create, remove, or modify. The name must be in lowercase and must not contain white spaces. For compatibility with earlier versions of Docker, the name must be at least four characters long.

__Type__: string

__Required__: True

__Default value__: None

### newName

New name for the organization. Setting this option changes the name of the organization which current name is provided in `name`. The token you use to connect to the API (in `quayToken`) must have the "Super User Access" permission.

__Type__: string

__Required__: False

__Default value__: None

### preserveInQuayOnDeletion

Whether to preserve the corresponding Quay object when you delete the Organization resource. When set to `false` (the default), the object is deleted from Quay.


__Type__: boolean

__Required__: False

__Default value__: False

### timeMachineExpiration

The amount of time, after a tag is deleted, that the tag is accessible in time machine before being garbage collected.

__Type__: string

__Required__: False

__Default value__: None


## Listing the Organization Resources

You can retrieve the list of the Organization custom resources in a namespace by using the `kubectl get` command:

```sh
kubectl get organizations.quay.herve4m.github.io -n <namespace>
```
You can also use the short version for the resource type:

```sh
kubectl get org -n <namespace>
```
